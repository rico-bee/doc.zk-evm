Note: Each user/wallet is limited to minting only 1 Badge NFT. If you have already minted one,  you will not be able to mint another one using the same wallet. Instead, you will see the following prompt but don’t worry you have already claimed your NFT.

Alternatively, you can start minting your badge and stay tuned for any perks you might collect when Atticc launches on Linea mainnet!
